The poor man's radiosonde receiver

What is it
---
An alternative firmware for the HC-14 LoRa modules for receiving and decoding meteorological radiosondes. To be used in conjunction with a USB TTL serial adapter.
Part of the code for the decoding is adapted from [sondedump](https://github.com/dbdexter-dev/sondedump). Inspiration was also taken from the [rs1729 demodulators](https://github.com/rs1729/RS)

Currently able to receive the following radiosondes:
- Vaisala RS41[^1]
- Meteomodem M10
- Meteomodem M20
- Graw DFM09

In case you don't own a NuLink programmer, the HC14Prog directory contains a sketch that enables an Arduino Nano (or similar board) to reprogram the HC-14 module.
Requires installation of the [CRC library](https://github.com/RobTillaart/CRC).
You need to connect 3 test points and power/ground to the Arduino as follows:

|Arduino|HC-14|
|---|---|
|5V|VCC|
|GND|GND|
|D2|nRESET|
|D3|ICE_CLK|
|D4|ICE_DAT|

This is only for the first time programming since you will be able to upgrade via a bootloader with the [NuvoISP utility](https://www.nuvoton.com/tool-and-software/software-tool/programmer-tool/).

&#x26A0; **Needless to say the original firmware will be lost forever, you will not be able to use your HC-14 module as before**
---

[^1]: Receive only, no decoding. Raw packet transmitted to host

Building
---
You will need [SDCC](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/), python 3 with the [urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3) and [crc](https://github.com/Nicoretti/crc) libraries.
[MCU support](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/MS51_BSP) must be installed too, it should reside in the parent directory.
After building the firmware binary you will be able to compile the Arduino sketch for programming the board.

How to connect to the USB TTL serial adapter
---
|HC-14|adapter|
|---|---|
|VCC|+5V|
|GND|GND|
|TX|RX|
|RX|TX|

Input "protocol"
---
Line oriented
- ? request settings
- * request build time
- $ request instantaneous RSSI measurement
- = force print last position data
- !ttttttffffff 6 characters that represent the sonde type, case insensitive (rs41,m10,m20,dfm09), right padded with blanks, followed by 6 charactes indicating the requested frequency in kHz
- @ reboot in bootloader mode (for firmware updates)

Output "protocol"
---
Line oriented, first character specifies record type:
- D: decoded data. Followed by key:value pairs separated by commas
- P: raw packet. Followed by data in hex. Data is already "massaged" (manchester decoded and dewhitened)
- #: current settings. Followed by sonde type and  frequency in kHz separated by '@'
